1. Modify the ***matchDayReport*** method from the Utils.java class
The method will write text in the file received as argument in the following format:
	CSM Bucuresti 28 - 27 SCM Ramnicu Valcea
	HC Zalau 35 - 35 SCM Craiova
(every match on a new line, home team name followed by a space, home team goals,
space, - character, space, and then away team goals, space, away team name)

2. A CSV or Comma Separated Values is a special type of text file
that can be opened by Excel or any other spreadsheet editor
Modify the ***readFromCSV*** method from the Utils.java class
in such a manner that you can return the list of matches from the CSV file
received as argument (for a file draft please see "matches.csv" from the project)
The method will return an empty list if the file doesn't exist or cannot be read

3. You have a file called "secret.bin" that contains the number of championships
won by a certain team. The only information that you know is that the file is 
binary and that the information is an integer located after 12 bytes from the start
of the file. Modify the ***secretInfo*** method to return the number.
	
4. Modify the ***serialize*** method to write the list of matches into the 
binary file received as argument. You can use any method of binary serialization.
	
5. Modify the ***deserialize*** method to read the list of matches from the 
binary file received as argument. You should be able to deserialize the data
that you previously serialized.
	
6. Write the header of a CSV in the file received as argument by the method
***writeHeader***. The header will contain the following info:
NO TEAM PTS GF GA GD
where:
NO - position in the table
TEAM - the name of the team
PTS - number of points
GF - goals for
GA - goals against
GD - goals difference
The strings will be separated by a comma and a space
a new line will be added at the end of the row
	
7. Modify the ***writePoints*** method so that it writes a valid CSV file that
beside the header contains the team names and their number of points
The points in handball are awarded in the following manner:
0 points - for loosing team
3 points - for winning team
1 point - for both teams in case of draw

8. Modify the ***writePointsAndGoals*** method that beside the number of points
writes in the file the number of Goals For, Goals Against and the Goals Difference

9. Modify the ***leagueTable*** method that beside the previous info,
orders the teams from the file based on the number of points
(on position 1 will be the team with the highest number of points)
!!! Do not write the header this time
	
10. Modify the ***specialLeagueTable*** method that treats the cases when two
different teams have the same number of points. In this case the ranking is
done based on the following criteria (in this order):
- goal difference
- goals for
- alphabetical
!!! Do not write the header this time
